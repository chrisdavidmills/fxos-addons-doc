<p><strong>Important</strong>: Add-ons are only available on Firefox OS 2.5+.</p>
</div>

<p class="summary">Add-ons are a well-known concept in the world of web browsers, and this concept has been added to Firefox OS too. A single Firefox OS add-on can extend just one app, several, or all of them. This article provides a guide to creating your own Firefox OS add-ons, as well as hints, tips, and other information to be aware of.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Firefox OS Add-ons use the WebExtensions extension model, which is largely based on Chrome/Blink add-ons, providing many advantages to how add-ons are created, in terms of interoperability and features. To learn more, keep checking back on our growing WebExtensions documentation.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mozilla currently operates a repository of Firefox OS add-ons in the <a href="#Hackerplace">Hackerplace</a>. There are plans to eventually add add-ons to the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Firefox Marketplace</a>, but these are at a very early stage (see {{bug("1110914")}}.)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Developing_add-ons">Developing add-ons</h2>

<p>Add-ons are app packages composed of JavaScript, CSS, and other assets. However, they don't run as standalone apps. Instead, the add-on manifest includes special features to define what apps to apply the add-on to. When apps are launched on a Firefox OS device that has an add-on installed, the add-on is injected into any app that matches the pattern specifed in the filter.</p>

<p>Firefox OS add-ons use the same syntax and structure for their code as the new school of Firefox add-ons developed using the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions">WebExtensions API</a>, which is itself based on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions">Chrome extensions</a> model.</p>

<h3 id="A_simple_example">A simple example</h3>

<p>To help explain Firefox OS add-on basics, we'll introduce a simple example that adds a banner to every app installed on the phone, which can be clicked to dismiss it.</p>

<p>[INSERT SCREENSHOT]</p>

<p>This is very basic and trivial, but it gives you enough to get started. You can check out the code on Github, and install the add-on on your Firefox OS device by going to the index page and clicking the install button.</p>

<p>Be aware that Firefox OS add-ons can do a lot more than what we've got listed here. The WebExtensions documentation will have more information added as time goes on.</p>


<h2 id="The_anatomy_of_a_Firefox_OS_add-on">The anatomy of a Firefox OS add-on</h2>

<p>In this section we'll walkthrough the contents of the sample add-on repo, explaining each piece of content. The directory structure looks like this:</p>

<ul class="directory-tree">
 <li>simple-addon/
  <ul>
   <li>index.html</li>
   <li>css/
    <ul>
     <li>style.css</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>js/
    <ul>
     <li>index.js</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>icons/
    <ul>
     <li>128.png</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>manifest.json</li>
   <li>update.webapp</li>
   <li>extension.zip</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="index.html">index.html</h3>

<p>The HTML index file doesn't even need to be there, for the extension to work. At a basic level an extension works by injecting JavaScript (and other things) into an existing app.</p>

<p>However, it is useful to have the index.html file present here for other purposes, such as providing some more information about your extension and providing an install button if you are hosting your extension yourself. See your example index.html on Github.</p>

<h3 id="CSS">CSS</h3>

<p>There is nothing special about the CSS included in the example. The only thing to bear in mind is that you should wrap your functionality in one or more containers with unique classnames. You will be injecting your CSS into any app(s) you apply the add-on to, so you need to make sure that it doesn't clash with any existing classnames in the app(s).</p>

<p>For example, we wrapped our example banner in a div with class fxos-banner. But you could even consider using some kind of unique code for your classname.</p>

<h3 id="JavaScript">JavaScript</h3>

<p>Again, the JavaScript file that powers the add-on doesn't have any special functionality inside it (see the JavaScript source on Github.) It is injected into the apps it is applied to along with any CSS specified in the {{anch("manifest.json")}} file.

<p>Note: Add-on code is injected every time an app is launched and the match specified in manifest.json pattern matches that app. They are also injected whenever they are enabled. When an add-on is injected into an app because the app is launching, all add-on files are injected into the app before anything in the app is initialized, including the DOM.</p>

Other main things to note are covered below.</p>

<h4 id="DOM_injection">DOM injection</h4>

<p>There is no way to inject DOM content into the app's DOM, so you need to use JavaScript to create any new nodes your add-on needs.</p>

<p>Add-ons only share a proxied version of the content <code>window</code>. As a result, anything that is written to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> object from an add-on is unavailable to the app code. However, anything on the <code>window</code> object that is set by app code is available to add-ons. Similarly, the DOM is accessible as usual.</p>

<h4 id="Injecting_code_at_the_correct_time">Injecting code at the correct time</h4>

<p>Next, you must be careful to properly handle cases where an add-on is injected into an app after the app has been loaded. Such a scenario can occur when an app is already running and an add-on that targets it is enabled. in such a case, a <code>window.onload</code> handler won't work because the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event has already occured.</p>

<p>There's no good solution to this problem right now. In the interim, we recommend to hackily check whether or not the DOM has been loaded before setting a <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> callback. This pattern is used in the demo:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">
// If injecting into an app that was already running at the time
// the app was enabled, simply initialize it.
if (document.documentElement) {
  initialize();
}

// Otherwise, we need to wait for the DOM to be ready before
// starting initialization since add-ons are usually (always?)
// injected *before* `document.documentElement` is defined.
else {
  window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initialize);
}

function initialize() {
  // ...
}
</pre>

<h4 id="Preventing_multiple_injections">Preventing multiple injections</h4>

<p>Finally, to prevent an add-on from being injected into a single app instance multiple times, you can set a DOM attribute denoting that the add-on has already been injected. If it's detected as being already set on injection, the add-on should abort its initialization process. We use a <code>helloWorldInitialized</code> attribute in our code, like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">
function initialize() {
  if (document.documentElement.dataset.helloWorldInitialized) {
    // Already injected, abort.
    return;
  } else {
    var body = document.querySelector('body');
    var fxosBanner = document.createElement('div');
    fxosBanner.classList.add('fxos-banner');
    var bannerText = document.createElement('p');
    var closeBtn = document.createElement('button');

    fxosBanner.appendChild(bannerText);
    fxosBanner.appendChild(closeBtn);
    body.appendChild(fxosBanner);

    closeBtn.textContent = 'X';
    bannerText.textContent = 'Wow, you have an extension installed!';

    document.documentElement.dataset.helloWorldInitialized = true;

    closeBtn.onclick = function() {
      fxosBanner.parentNode.removeChild(fxosBanner);
      document.documentElement.dataset.helloWorldInitialized = false;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Note how clicking the button to remove the banner sets the <code>helloWorldInitialized</code> attribute back to <code>false</code> â€” if the user cleared the banner last time; we want to show it to them again! (evil marketing techniques never get die.)</p>

<h4 id="App_management_functions_in_add-ons">App management functions in add-ons</h4>

<p>All <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry">Apps</a></code> and <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/mgmt">Mgmt</a></code> functions work on add-ons just like they do on apps. In addition to these functions, an <code><a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/Apps.webidl#141">onenabledstatechange</a></code> callback is exposed for add-ons being enabled and disabled. This event is fired for all add-ons, so you will have to check which add-on was enabled/disabled before performing initialization or cleanup.</p>

<pre>
<span>navigator.mozApps.mgmt</span>.<span>onenabledstatechange</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span>(<span>event</span>) {
  var app = event.application;
  if (app.manifestURL === 'https://origin.of.manifest/manifest.webapp') {
    var wasEnabled = app.enabled;
    // do something with this information
  }
};
</pre>


<h3 id="Including_an_icon">Including an icon</h3>

<p>You need to include at least one icon and reference it from your manifest, otherwise the manifest doesn't validate. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest#icons">the Manifest reference icons section</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="manifest.json">manifest.json</h3>

<p>You'll notice that we've got two manifest-type files inside our sample add-on directory. The first of these â€” manifest.json â€” follows the Chrome-style manifest style, and is placed inside the extensions package. It can contain a large variety of instructions (see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest">Chrome Manifest File Format</a>), but for now we're just going to concentrate on a simple subset:</p>

<pre>{
    "manifest_version": 1,
    "name": "Add-on banner",
    "description": "Firefox OS add-on example",
    "version": "1.0",
    "author": "Chris Mills",
    "content_scripts": [{
      "matches": ["*"],
      "css": ["css/style.css"],
      "js": ["js/index.js"]
    }],
    "icons": {
      "128": "/icons/128.png"
    }
}</pre>

<p>Most of these fields are pretty self-explanatory, but we'll cover the last few.</p>

<p>First of all, the content_scripts field references the code that will be injected into apps that the add-on is applied to â€” you'll see that we are providing the path to the CSS and JavaScript files in the css and js fields. The matches field contains a pattern that specifies which apps the code will be injected into. This pattern can take a number of different forms (see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns">Chrome Match Patterns</a>), but for now we are simply specifying *, which means "all apps".</p>

<p>Note: You can reference multiple scripts and stylesheets by simply including multiple items in the arrays, for example <code>"css": ["css/style.css", "css/more.css"]</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Firefox OS does not currently support the Chrome &lt;all_urls&gt;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the manifest we've included the icons field; see the next section for more info on this.</p>

<h3 id="update.webapp">update.webapp</h3>

<p>The <code>update.webapp</code> manifest is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest">Firefox OS-style Manifest</a>, which is basically a packaged app-style mini-manifest (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Options/Self_publishing#Self-publishing_packaged_apps">Self-publishing packaged apps</a>.)</p>

<p>Our update.webapp looks like so:</p>

{
  "name" : "Add-on banner",
  "description": "Firefox OS add-on example",
  "developer": { "name": "Chris Mills" },
  "package_path": "extension.zip",
  "icons": {
    "128": "/icons/128.png"
  }
}

<p>Again, most of this is fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Probably the most important field in here is package_path, which points to the package that contains the extension.</p>

<p>You'll notice that the icons field is included here, the same as it is in manifest.json â€” update.webapp is the only place you <em>need</em> to have the icons information at the moment, but we'd recommend you include it in both place for now, just in case things change. The icons field points to the add-on icon so it can be used in Gaia, add-on marketplaces like Hackerplace, etc.</p>

<h3 id="extension.zip">extension.zip</h3>

<p>The extension.zip archive contains the code for the extension, and is referenced in the update_webapp package_path field â€” This is how Gecko finds the code to be installed. Archived inside you'll find:</p>

<ul class="directory-tree">
   <li>css/
    <ul>
     <li>style.css</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>js/
    <ul>
     <li>index.js</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>icons/
    <ul>
     <li>128.png</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>manifest.json</li>
</ul>

<p>So the manifest.json file sits inside the archive, and serves to reference the files to be injected, and specifies which apps to affect. All of them, in our sample's case.</p>

<h2 id="Installation">Installing and distributing add-ons</h2>

<p>Add-ons are packaged just like any other app, therefore they can be installed in the same ways. For example, if you wanted to distribute your own add-on, you could use some code like the block below to allow people to install your add-on from a web page (see our sample add-on index.html for full code). The code uses the installPackage() method to install the add-on. In terms of installation, it is effectively a packaged app:</p>

<pre>var installBtn = document.querySelector('button');

installBtn.onclick = function() {
  install('update.webapp')
}

function install(url) {
  navigator.mozApps.installPackage('https://chrisdavidmills.github.io/simple-addon/' + url);
}</pre>

<p>Support is being added to allow add-ons to be installed via <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> soon as well (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1196734). Bear in mind that they do need to be privileged apps â€” either served via a marketplace, sideloaded, installed while in developer mode, etc. Once installed however you don't need any special privileges to apply them to apps.</p>

<h3 id="Hackerplace">Hackerplace</h3>

<p>Add-ons are currently an experimental feature only available to specific test versions of Firefox OS. Therefore, they are not available on the general Firefox Marketplace yet, so for the moment they are being collected in a repository called <a href="https://github.com/fxos/directory/">Hackerplace</a>.</p>

<p>To submit your add-on to Hackerplace:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure your add-on is created according to the pattern set out in our sample add-on shown above.</li>
 <li>Put it into a github repo, and push everything to your <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
 <li>follow the Hackerplace submission process by forking and submitting a pull request to that repository, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/fxos/directory/#readme">Hackerplace README file</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Refer to an existing add-on like <a href="https://github.com/mikehenrty/fxos-shb-plus/tree/gh-pages">Homebar Plus</a> as an example.</p>

<h2 id="Enablingdisabling_add-ons">Enabling/disabling add-ons</h2 >

<p>By default, add-ons are enabled after installation. They can be enabled/disabled via <em>Settings app &gt; Add-ons</em>, or programmatically using the <code><a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/Apps.webidl#135">navigator.mozApps.mgmt.setEnabled()</a></code> function.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is currently a bug requiring the <code>network.disable.ipc.security</code> to be disabled for extensions to work. This can be done manually, or by enabling <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_Mode">Developer Mode</a>. This should be fixed soon.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Add-ons inherit their permissions entirely from their host app. Requesting permissions in the add-on manifest (see {{anch("update.webapp")}}) will have no effect, and will not expose any APIs to the add-on that are not available to the host app.</p>


<h2 id="Running_add-ons_as_apps">Running add-ons as apps</h2>

<p>Add-ons can run as apps when launched directly, e.g.:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">
navigator.mozApps.mgmt.getAll().then(function(apps) {
  apps.forEach(function(app) {
    if (app.manifest.name === 'Hello World Addon') {
      app.launch();
    }
  });
});
</pre>

<p>In this mode, they function identically to an app with the same manifest, files, etc.</p>

  </body>
</html>
